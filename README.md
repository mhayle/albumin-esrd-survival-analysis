# albumin-esrd-survival-analysis

# Overview
This project aims to investigate the correlation between serum albumin levels, an indicator of nutritional status, and mortality risk in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing hemodialysis. Utilizing data from an observational study of 1,979 patients across US dialysis clinics, we'll analyze demographic, laboratory, and periodic albumin measurements to test the hypothesis that serum albumin could be a potential independent biomarker for predicting mortality in this patient population. Successful results could provide an additional tool for nephrologists to potentially decrease mortality risk in hemodialysis patients. We'll first use initial patient data to determine how albumin levels relate to mortality risk, and see if this relationship changes for patients with a history of heart disease. Then, we'll use updated albumin measurements over time to repeat our analysis and understand any differences. Lastly, we'll perform the same analysis with a smaller, specifically chosen group of patients and compare our findings. There are three main quetion I want to address in thi analysis:

1. What is the association between baseline serum albumin and the risk of mortality?
2. What is the potential difference in the association between baseline albumin and the risk of mortality comparing patients with and without a history of cardiovascular disease?
3. Quantify the association between serum albumin as a time-dependent variable and the risk of mortality.
4. How would the reuslt cange if we redid the analysis as a nested case-control study?

This analysis is done in R using the **survival** package.
